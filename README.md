# Stock Analysis using VBA
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose  
  The purpose of this analysis was to take alphabetized stock information from multiple worksheets and analyze its performance over a period of two different years.  We wrote a code that analyzed one specific stock, then refactored it to run the analysis on all of the stocks in the worksheets.  The original code was written to help a client determine if a specific stock was worth investing in, while the refactored code assisted the client in making a decision regarding all of the listed stocks.
### Results
  Refactoring the code allowed us to see the perfomance of all 12 stocks over the course of 2017 and 2018.  Pictured below are the results of both analysis
