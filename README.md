# Stock Analysis using VBA
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose  
  The purpose of this analysis was to take alphabetized stock information from multiple worksheets and analyze its performance over a period of two different years.  We wrote a code that analyzed one specific stock, then refactored it to run the analysis on all of the stocks in the worksheets.  The original code was written to help a client determine if a specific stock was worth investing in, while the refactored code assisted the client in making a decision regarding all of the listed stocks.
